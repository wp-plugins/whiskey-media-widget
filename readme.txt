Requires at least: 3.0
Tested up to: 3.5.2
Stable tag: 0.3.1

Fetches a list of games from the specified Whiskey Media website based on the post tags.

== Description ==

This sidebar widget checks the tags for the current post and searches a Whiskey Media site database for the specified items. A Giant Bomb widget will search for games and a Comic Vine widget will search for comic book characters.

You will need a Whiskey Media API Key to use this widget:
http://api.giantbomb.com/
http://api.comicvine.com/

Note: the widget will fetch items based on Whiskey Media's own search algorithm which may not return exactly what you want it to. You've been warned.

== Installation ==

Upload the wmwidgets plugin to your blog, activate it, then add the widgets entering your API key for the specific site you want to use.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why do I need an API key? =
It ensures that there isn't a crazy amount of traffic associated with my personal API key and in case the API key is deleted at any point, the widget will still work.

= Why is there no support for <insert WM-site here>? =
Last time I checked, that site didn't have an active API yet. If a Whiskey Media site you know has an active API and the plugin doesn't support it, please email me and I will rectify it as soon as I can.

== Screenshots ==

1. Remember to get yourself an API key
2. You need a separate API key for the different sites
3. Giant bomb will show games
4. Comic Vine will show comic book characters
