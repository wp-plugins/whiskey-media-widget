Fetches a list of games from the specified Whiskey Media website based on the post tags.

== Description ==

This sidebar widget checks the tags for the current post and searches a Whiskey Media site database for the specified items. A Giant Bomb widget will search for games and a Comic Vine widget will search for comic book characters.

You will need a Whiskey Media API Key to use this widget:
http://api.giantbomb.com/
http://api.comicvine.com/

Note: the widget will fetch items based on Whiskey Media's own search algorithm which may not return exactly what you want it to. You've been warned.

== Installation ==

Upload the wmwidget plugin to your blog, activate it, then add the widgets entering your API key for the specific site you want to use.
